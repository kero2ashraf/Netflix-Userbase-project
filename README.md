# Netflix-Userbase-project

Here i am talking about Netflix userbase that consists of age of the user , monthly revenue , subscription types , device that the user use it , country and plan duration
for example:
 user age like 28 from USA uses basic subscirption and its monthly revenue 10 and this user use smart phone and its duration plan 1 month


 python packages :
 1) numpy
 2) pandas
 3) matplotlib.pyplot
 4) seaborn

my questions : 
1) Make an overview of the data and check for any missing values or duplicates ?
2) make a statistical summary about your data?
3) show a gender distribution between Gender and the count?
4) show a Age group  distribution between age of the user and the count?
5) Make a pie chart to show the percentages about the subsciption types ?
6) Make a box plot to show the relationship between Monthly revenue and subscription types?
7) Make a correlation using heatmaps about Monthly revenue and age ?
8) Make a countplot between the count of the users that uses Netflix and the country they came from?
9) Make a boxplot between Monthly revenue and Gender to get a statistical summary?
10) Make a violinplot between age and subscription type distribution?
11)  Make a countplot about device usage means how many users uses smart phones?
12)  Finally Make a scatterplot to see the correlation between Monthly Revenue and plan duration?

Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Netflix Userbase Dataset, we identified significant variations in gender distribution, age demographics, and subscription types, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and tailored content offerings in the competitive streaming industry.
